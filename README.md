Python Peer to Peer chatting app over an implementation of a reliable UDP protocol & file transfer over TCP. (Stop & Wait)

Requirements
------------
Python (application tested using Python v3.9)
Tkinter: pip install tk

[Minor fixes and improvements & future considerations]
- Sequence number wraparound
- Accepting IP addresses as inputs
- GUI improvement
- Avoid file overwriting by either increasing file name by 1(file0,file1,..) or getting the name of the file from the sending peer along with the file
- Not make it stop & wait
